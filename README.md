        ABOUT THE RESTAURANT APP 	

        Hey there! Welcome to the READ ME. I wanted to tell you about some
        of the tools I used and a little bit about the process. Restaurant App
        Challenge was made using a wide range of dependencies with the goal of
        achieving an efficient and attractive app for the user.

        The App was built and tested using a Windows Operative System and
        Android Phone. Since the Guidelines of the challenge specified not using
        EXPO it was impossible to test on IOS environment. Please test it on
        Android.

        Regarding navigation, I used libraries like @react-navigation/drawer and
        @react-navigation/bottom-tabs to give it a simple and dynamic flow.

        One of the main challenges was implementing the geolocation
        functionalities, the use of the Maps API and the permissions. To achieve
        this I use dependencies react-native-community/geolocation,
        react-native-maps and react-native-permissions. I think I managed to
        integrate these functionalities and the result is smooth and intuitive.

        Regarding the design components I decided to use the React Native
        Elements library for the search bar and some texts,
        react-native-vector-icons to add icons. These libraries made my job a
        lot easier and allowed me to achieve a polished design.
        {'\n\n'}I did my best to design a stunning app that met the requirements
        of the BetterVet Challenge. Despite the challenges, I thoroughly enjoyed
        building this App and I feel proud of the final result. I hope you enjoy
        it too.
